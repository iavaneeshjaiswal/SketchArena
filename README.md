## 🎨 **About the Game**

In **SketchArena**, players join or create game rooms to engage in drawing sessions:  
- One player is chosen as the **Sketcher** each round, tasked with drawing a randomly assigned word on a digital canvas.  
- Other players observe the sketch in real time and race against the clock to guess the correct word.  
- Points are awarded for accurate guesses and the Sketcher’s ability to clearly convey the word.  

At the end of each game, the player with the highest score is crowned the **winner**!
